User Registration
==========
User registration requires first name, last name, mobile, email, and password.
Once that data has been entered, the user will need to confirm their email in order to proceed.
Users can't use emails that are already in the system. Users must enter a valid landline or mobile phone. Phone is validated through the Telnyx lookup.

NOTE: Phone validation has been turned off until further notice due to the lookup service being unreliable. We are looking into finding a more reliable solution
